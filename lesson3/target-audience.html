                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The target audience is anyone who wants to know about upcoming weather conditions,
                    so they can better plan their time.
                </p>
                <h2>Personas</h2>
                <h3>Greg Roberts</h3>
                <p>Greg Roberts is a 43-year-old father of 2 planning a trip to the local park with his family. He wants to go on a day when it isn't supposed to rain.
                    It being sunny is not necessary - he lives in an area that's frequently rainy and is used to cool air.
                    Greg Roberts would be accessing this site on his phone during his break at work.
                </p>
                <h3>Jenny Johnson</h3>
                <p>Jenny Johnson is 24 years old, single, career-oriented, and can't stand obstacles. If a site doesn't make it easy to
                    access the information she wants, she goes to another provider for that service. She would access this site from
                    her laptop, because she's always on her laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>Scenarios</h2>
                <p>1: I want to go fishing Saturday, is the weather any good for that?</p>
                <p>2: I've got to pay my taxes this week, but the farm needs work done. Is there going to be a rainy day?</p>
                <p>3: I'm planning to take a vacation week in March to go hiking. When will it be dry and cool?</p>
                <p>4: I'm afraid of lightning and want a site that will let me know in advance what days to stay inside.</p>
                <p>5: When will it be coolest in the mountains this month?</p>
