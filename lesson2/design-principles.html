        <h2>The Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>Example from Google Images <br> <a href="google.com">google.com</a></h3>
        <img src="images/thirds.jpg" alt="The Rule of Thirds example">
        <p>The rule of thirds is that, if you divide an image into thirds both vertically and horizontally,
            the subjects of the image should usually fall on one of those lines. If you imagine those lines,
            then (numbered as if by a grid) the content is all on the second and third horizontal line.

    <div id="proximity">
        <h2>PARC: Proximity</h2>
        <h3>Example from Nintendo <br> <a href="nintendo.com">nintendo.com</a></h3>
        <img src="images/proximity.jpg" alt="PARC: Proximity example">
        <p>This image uses proximity to group related items together. It's immediately obvious what
            "Explore gaming systems" and "Popular deals" are referring to, because the relevant
            information is right there within the same listing.

    <div id="whitespace">
        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Example from Apple <br> <a href="apple.com">apple.com</a></h3>
        <img src="images/whitespace.jpg" alt="White Space example">
        <p>Apple has always been fond of using white space in their advertising. Here, with only a
            few text elements and an image of an iPad, there isn't much information to absorb,
            and it's all easy to read. This is effective in getting across information before
            losing the audience's attention.
